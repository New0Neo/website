                Are Orange apples or are apples oranges 
                Let’s compare apples to oranges.
                At first glance, they are two different colors. I think I’ve never seen an apple or an orange; the only reason why I know about them is from documents. What is called 
                <span id="more-content" class="read-more-content">
                     an apple has many different colors. For example, the scientific name for a green apple is MALUS DOMESTICA M. SYLVESTRIS. I would not have known that if people didn’t add apple to the name, as said in the document, “Commonly referred to as green apples.” So I’m assuming that’s an apple, and lemons might also be apples, which gives us information about what an apple is. With that logic, since lemons have the same texture as oranges, that makes them both apples. I still feel that I need more information. The scientific name of an apple is Malus Pumila, and the scientific name of an orange is orange. That's confusing. It was when I wanted to know the details that there could be a family of food that is somehow related to each other. I looked more into what oranges are. There are two types of oranges. The scientific name of a sweet orange is Citrus sinensis; for a bitter orange, it’s called Citrus aurantium. That doesn’t tell me much, and there is also another orange apple called Cox's Orange Pippin. I am certain it’s an apple since the textures are said to be the same. That's an argument for another day. Let's look at the timeline: oranges first appeared in 314 BC, apples appeared in 2200 BC, and lemons as we know them today appeared around 200 BCE. Now I know that apples and oranges are their own things.
